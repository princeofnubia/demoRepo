    <h1>Goal</h1>

    <p class="do-something">The goal is to ensure that we integrate more black folks into the tech sphere as more Indians have taken the place and are still busy taking the place</p>

    <p class="do-another"> We have seen the works of the Indian and we believe our black folks are able and capable to deliver better service should they be given the opportunity </p>

    <p>We have validated this and we believe that we can make it happen.</p>
